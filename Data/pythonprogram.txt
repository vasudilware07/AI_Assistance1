Certainly, I can help you with writing a Python program. Here's an example of a Python program that calculates the factorial of a number:
```python
# This program calculates the factorial of a number

# Ask the user for a number
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Initialize the factorial to 1
factorial = 1

# Calculate the factorial by multiplying the number with the factorial of the number - 1
for i in range(1, number + 1):
    factorial *= i

# Print out the factorial
print(f"The factorial of {number} is {factorial}.")
```
This program uses a `for` loop to calculate the factorial of a number by multiplying the number with the factorial of the number - 1, until the factorial of 1 is reached. The `input()` function is used to get input from the user, and the `int()` function is used to convert the input from a string to an integer. The `print()` function is used to output the result to the console.

Let me know if you have any specific requirements or functionality that you would like to include in your Python program, and I would be happy to help.
