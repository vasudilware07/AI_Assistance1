 Hello Mohakraj, I'd be happy to write a song for you! Here's a short and upbeat song that I came up with:

(Verse 1)
Wake up in the morning, feeling alive
Got a whole day ahead, can't wait to thrive
Put on a smile, and face the sun
Gonna make the most of the day, and have some fun

(Chorus)
Life is a journey, it's up to you
To make the most of every moment, and see it through
With every step you take, and every choice you make
Make sure you're living life, and not just awake

(Verse 2)
Take a deep breath, and enjoy the view
Every day is a gift, a chance to break through
Find your passion, and chase your dreams
With hard work and dedication, you'll achieve

(Chorus)
Life is a journey, it's up to you
To make the most of every moment, and see it through
With every step you take, and every choice you make
Make sure you're living life, and not just awake

(Bridge)
Don't let fear or doubt, hold you back
Embrace the unknown, and keep moving track
Take risks, and learn from mistakes
With a positive mindset, there's no limit to what you can create

(Chorus)
Life is a journey, it's up to you
To make the most of every moment, and see it through
With every step you take, and every choice you make
Make sure you're living life, and not just awake

(Outro)
So go out there, and seize the day
With a smile on your face, and a fire in your heart
Life is a beautiful journey, so make it worth it
And never forget, it's your story, your legacy, your worth.
